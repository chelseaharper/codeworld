Welcome to CodeWorld!
=====================
CodeWorld is an educational computer programming environment.
By using a simple mathematical model for geometric shapes and transformations, you
can create drawings, animations, and even single-player and multi-player video games!
The programming language used is a variation of [Haskell](http://haskell.org), but
you can think of it as just talking to the computer using mathematics.

This is the CodeWorld Guide, which will help get you started.  Click outside the guide
to start programming.  The *Guide* button at the bottom of the screen will get you
back here.

Overview
========

To get an idea what you can do in CodeWorld, you might want to check out the
[CodeWorld Gallery](/gallery.html), with examples of projects built by students.

Tips for using this guide
-------------------------

* This guide works best if you try things; it won't do much good to just read. If you
  feel the urge to play around with something, please do! You can always come back after.
* Many of the examples in this guide can be copied into the CodeWorld editor and run as
  is! If you see a blue box, you can click it to copy the code and try it out.
